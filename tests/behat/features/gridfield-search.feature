Feature: Search in GridField
  As an author
  I want to search an item in the CMS
  So that I see proper result and don't see warning

  Background:
    Given the "Company" "ExxonMobil" with "Category"="Oil"
    And the "Company" "Vitol" with "Category"="Other"
    And the "Company" "Walmart" with "Category"="Retail"
    And the "Company" "Walmart B" with "Category"="Retail"
    And the "Company" "Walmart C" with "Category"="Retail"
    And the "Company" "Walmart D" with "Category"="Retail"
    And the "Company" "ConocoPhillips" with "Category"="Oil"
    And the "Company" "Saudi Aramco" with "Category"="Oil"
    And the "Company" "Eni" with "Category"="Oil"
    And the "Company" "Gazprom" with "Category"="Oil"
    And the "Company" "Pemex" with "Category"="Oil"
    And the "Company" "Chevron" with "Category"="Oil"
    And the "group" "EDITOR" has permissions "Access to 'Pages' section" and "Access to 'Test ModelAdmin' section" and "Access to 'GridField Test Navigation' section" and "TEST_DATAOBJECT_EDIT"
    # This extension will limit to only showing 3 records per page so that pagination shows
    And I add an extension "FrameworkTestModelAdminExtension" to the "TestModelAdmin" class
    And I am logged in as a member of "EDITOR" group

  Scenario: I can search and go to item
    When I go to "/admin/test"
      And I press the "Open search and filter" button
      And I press the "Advanced" button
    Then I should see a "#Form_CompaniesSearchForm_Search_Name.no-change-track" element
      And I fill in "Search__Name" with "Walmart"
      And I press the "Enter" key in the "Search__Name" field
    Then I should see "Walmart" in the "#Form_EditForm" element
      But I should not see "ExxonMobil" in the ".col-Name" element
      And I should not see "Vitol" in the ".col-Name" element
      And I click "Walmart" in the "#Form_EditForm" element
    Then I should see "Walmart"
      And I should see "Walmart" in the ".breadcrumbs-wrapper" element

  Scenario: I can see pagination after search
    When I go to "/admin/gridfield-test-navigation"
      And I should see "Walmart" in the "#Form_EditForm" element
      And I press the "Open search and filter" button
      And I press the "Advanced" button
      And I fill in "Search__Category" with "Oil"
      And I press the "Enter" key in the "Search__Category" field
    Then I should see "ExxonMobil" in the "#Form_EditForm" element
      But I should not see "Walmart" in the ".col-Name" element
      And I should not see "Vitol" in the ".col-Name" element
      And I should see "2" in the ".pagination-page-number" element
      And I should see "View 1–5 of 7" in the ".pagination-records-number" element
    Then I click on the "#action_pagination_next" element
      And I should see "View 6–7 of 7" in the ".pagination-records-number" element
      And I should see "Pemex" in the "#Form_EditForm" element

  Scenario: I can clear search and paginate
    When I go to "/admin/test"
    And I press the "Open search and filter" button
    # This will match on all of the "Walmart" records
    And I fill in "SearchBox__q" with "a a"
    And I press the "Enter" key in the "SearchBox__q" field
    Then the "[name=SearchBox__q]" element "value" attribute should be "a a"
    And I should see "Walmart" in the ".ss-gridfield-item:nth-of-type(1) .col-Name" element
    And I should see "Walmart B" in the ".ss-gridfield-item:nth-of-type(2) .col-Name" element
    And I should see "Walmart C" in the ".ss-gridfield-item:nth-of-type(3) .col-Name" element
    And I should not see "ExxonMobil" in the ".col-Name" element
    And I should not see "Vitol" in the ".col-Name" element
    And I click on the ".search-box__cancel" element
    When I click on the "#action_pagination_next" element
    And I press the "Open search and filter" button
    Then the "[name=SearchBox__q]" element "value" attribute should be ""
    And I should see "Walmart B" in the ".ss-gridfield-item:nth-of-type(1) .col-Name" element
    And I should see "Walmart C" in the ".ss-gridfield-item:nth-of-type(2) .col-Name" element
    And I should see "Walmart D" in the ".ss-gridfield-item:nth-of-type(3) .col-Name" element
